C10 Integrated ABM-DTA Models (Part 1: Theoretical Considerations),"Integration of advanced Activity-Based Models (ABMs) of travel demand with network simulation tools such as Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) is considered as one of the important strategic directions in our profession. Recently completed pioneering SHRP C10 projects for Sacramento, CA and Jacksonville, FL have brought a first valuable experience with ABM-DTA integration, proved feasibility of such an integrated model, as well as portrayed some important modeling and computational issues that have to be resolved before the new generation of integrated models could be recommended for a wide use in practice. In 2014-2015, several follow-up SHRP C10 projects were started in parallel with different ABM and DTA platforms being integrated, as well as several MPO-sponsored ABM-DTA integration projects. In some of these projects, the original concept of ABM-DTA integration was extended to incorporate the transit side (both vehicle and passenger movements) in a microsimulation fashion as well. The purpose of Part 1 of this workshop is to bring a wide audience of researchers and practitioners together to discuss the recent progress on the ongoing SHRP C10 projects, theoretical issues encountered, and innovative methods for integrating ABM and DTA.",5/1/16 13:00,5/1/16 14:45,,,"Workshop, Session",lei-zhang,,,sun-p1-1
Strategic Analysis Tools for Scenario Planning (SHRP C16),"A network of regional agencies with the support of the National Association of Regional Councils (NARC) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), has come together to accelerate the adoption and deployment of scenario planning tools. The goal of these efforts are to lower the barriers to entry, set strong guidelines for high-quality data and applications, design an effective delivery network for getting planning support systems up and running and provide technical assistance on adopting and improving the use of strategic planning methods for scenario planning. The workshop will offer an overview of techniques currently in use by state and local planning agencies, followed by an introduction to recently developed predictive strategic planning tools. A panel discussion will follow that will seek to identify barriers and strategies for improving analytical practices used in scenario planning to aide in the development a roadmap for increasing adoption.",5/1/16 13:00,5/1/16 14:45,,,"Workshop, Session","eric-pihl,tara-weidner",,,sun-p1-2
