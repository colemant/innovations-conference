C10 Integrated ABM-DTA Models (Part 1: Theoretical Considerations),"Integration of advanced Activity-Based Models (ABMs) of travel demand with network simulation tools such as Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) is considered as one of the important strategic directions in our profession. Recently completed pioneering SHRP C10 projects for Sacramento, CA and Jacksonville, FL have brought a first valuable experience with ABM-DTA integration, proved feasibility of such an integrated model, as well as portrayed some important modeling and computational issues that have to be resolved before the new generation of integrated models could be recommended for a wide use in practice. In 2014-2015, several follow-up SHRP C10 projects were started in parallel with different ABM and DTA platforms being integrated, as well as several MPO-sponsored ABM-DTA integration projects. In some of these projects, the original concept of ABM-DTA integration was extended to incorporate the transit side (both vehicle and passenger movements) in a microsimulation fashion as well. The purpose of Part 1 of this workshop is to bring a wide audience of researchers and practitioners together to discuss the recent progress on the ongoing SHRP C10 projects, theoretical issues encountered, and innovative methods for integrating ABM and DTA.",5/1/2016 13:00,5/1/2016 14:45,,,"Workshop, Session",lei-zhang,,,sun-p1-1
Strategic Analysis Tools for Scenario Planning (SHRP C16),"A network of regional agencies with the support of the National Association of Regional Councils (NARC) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), has come together to accelerate the adoption and deployment of scenario planning tools. The goal of these efforts are to lower the barriers to entry, set strong guidelines for high-quality data and applications, design an effective delivery network for getting planning support systems up and running and provide technical assistance on adopting and improving the use of strategic planning methods for scenario planning. The workshop will offer an overview of techniques currently in use by state and local planning agencies, followed by an introduction to recently developed predictive strategic planning tools. A panel discussion will follow that will seek to identify barriers and strategies for improving analytical practices used in scenario planning to aide in the development a roadmap for increasing adoption.",5/1/2016 13:00,5/1/2016 14:45,,,"Workshop, Session","eric-pihl,tara-weidner",,,sun-p1-2

Moving Innovations to Practice,"Successful innovations in Travel Modeling often follow a logical progression from research to application.  Innovation at the research phase inherently involves successes and failures -- both which add value as our industry evolves (provided each are well documented and shared).  Applications of models, which are inherently conducted to solve problems, educate decision makers and/or inform policy, should be understandabel and minimize failure.  It is the transition from innovation to application that is critical and challenging.  Entire industries have evolved to tackle this problem and many innvations fail to move into application not becaues of their gunius but for other, more mundate, reasons, including leadership failures, inappropriate allocation of funding, uncertain expectations, constraints of ownership, and willingness to accept mediocrity.  This panel will share ideas and motivate discussion around how we in the transportation sector currently and ideally should, transition innovation into application.",5/3/2016 13:30,5/3/2016 15:00,,,"Discussion, Session",david-ory,,,tue-p1-2

"Part 1: Mission, Vision, Goals","Let's pretend we have formed a foundation committed to improving travel modeling practice. This is our first formal meeting and we are setting out to articulate the Mission, Vision, and Goals of our newly-formed body. In the first hour of the session, we'll first introduce the concept by showing the mission/vision/goals statements of well-known corporations, e.g. Google, Campbell's Soup. In addition, we will consider the mission/vision/goals statements of well-known non-profits, such as Apache Foundation, World Bank, RAND Corporation, etc. We'll then work in small groups to brainstorm our hypothetical foundation's Mission, Vision, and Goals, recording our ideas in GitHub (a GitHub-ready individual will staff each table). To facilitate the process given limited time, the discussion will be seeded with an initial set of missions/visions/goals that will be developed beforehand. Participants can choose to join a group focused on refining one of the existing missions/visions/goals, or to join one or more ""none of the above"" groups and initiate their own. Examples of starting points can be drawn from the list of goals currently shown in the Proposed Solution section of this github page.  We'll then come together to discuss the different ideas. The audience will be asked to vote on the mission/vision/goal presented by each group using the -1, 0, +1 metric. While the outcome will be non-binding, this will provide a means of gauging initial sentiment. ",,,,,"Discussion, Presentation",,,,wed-a1-3-a
