C10 Integrated ABM-DTA Models (Part 1: Theoretical Considerations),"Integration of advanced Activity-Based
Models (ABMs) of travel demand
with network simulation tools such
as Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA)
is considered as one of the important
strategic directions in our profession.
Recently completed pioneering SHRP
C10 projects for Sacramento, CA and
Jacksonville, FL have brought a first
valuable experience with ABM-DTA
integration, proved feasibility of such an
integrated model, as well as portrayed
some important modeling and computational
issues that have to be resolved
before the new generation of integrated
models could be recommended for a
wide use in practice. In 2014-2015,
several follow-up SHRP C10 projects
were started in parallel with different
ABM and DTA platforms being integrated,
as well as several MPO-sponsored
ABM-DTA integration projects. In some
of these projects, the original concept
of ABM-DTA integration was extended
to incorporate the transit side (both
vehicle and passenger movements)
in a microsimulation fashion as well.
The purpose of Part 1 of this workshop
is to bring a wide audience of researchers
and practitioners together to discuss
the recent progress on the ongoing
SHRP C10 projects, theoretical issues
encountered, and innovative methods
for integrating ABM and DTA.",5/1/2016 13:00,5/1/2016 14:45,,,"Workshop, Session",lei-zhang,,,sun-p1-1
Strategic Analysis Tools for Scenario Planning (SHRP C16),"A network of regional agencies with the
support of the National Association of
Regional Councils (NARC) and Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA), has
come together to accelerate the adoption
and deployment of scenario planning
tools. The goal of these efforts are
to lower the barriers to entry, set strong
guidelines for high-quality data and applications,
design an effective delivery
network for getting planning support
systems up and running and provide
technical assistance on adopting and
improving the use of strategic planning
methods for scenario planning.
The workshop will offer an overview
of techniques currently in use by state
and local planning agencies, followed by
an introduction to recently developed
predictive strategic planning tools. A
panel discussion will follow that will
seek to identify barriers and strategies
for improving analytical practices
used in scenario planning to aide in the
development a roadmap for increasing
adoption.
